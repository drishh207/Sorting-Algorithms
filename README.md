1. Bubble Sort: <br />
   One of the most easy and basic sorting alogrithms. Every element is compared with its adjacent element and swapped accordingly.
   It is an in-place algorithm. 
   Time complexity: O(n^2) Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.
 
2. Selection Sort:
   The array divides into sorted and unsorted portions. In every iteration, the smallest element is found from the unsorted portion.
   It is then swapped with the first index of unsorted portion.
   It is an in-place algorithm.
   Time Complexity: O(n^2) quadratic complexity, but involves less swapping than bubble sort.
